# Work Breakdown Structure
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a project management tool that breaks a project into smaller, manageable components. It clarifies tasks, assigns responsibilities, and helps identify dependencies and risks. This document outlines the WBS for WBS.md, detailing essential tasks and milestones for effective project execution.
